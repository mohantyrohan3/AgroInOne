## Problem Statement

Indian farmers face several challenges, including the lack of access to information, the inability to sell their crop production at a fair price, and difficulty in accessing government-aided schemes. These challenges often result in reduced profits, financial losses, and the inability to grow their business. Therefore, there is a need for a platform that can provide farmers with access to information, help them sell their crop production at a fair price, and provide information about government-aided schemes.

## Solution

The website developed for Indian farmers aims to solve the challenges mentioned above by providing a one-stop-shop platform. The website provides farmers with access to information through the Buy and Sell section, where they can buy or sell their crop production and other materials. The integration of machine learning tools in the website helps farmers predict crop production and whether they will get a loan approval. The Google Maps integration enables farmers to locate the shops easily, and the Help Desk provides instant answers to the farmers' queries. The Schemes section provides information about various government-aided schemes available in their state. The User Login section ensures that the users can access additional features such as personalized recommendations, order tracking, etc. Overall, the website addresses the challenges faced by Indian farmers, provides them with a platform to access information, and helps them grow their business.
